# Full Stack Data Science Assignments Repository

This repository contains all the assignments given by iNeuron faculties. Each assignment is placed in a separate folder with all the necessary files and instructions. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my progress and growth in my learning journey with iNeuron.

The assignments will cover a wide range of topics and technologies, including machine learning, data science, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and more. This repository serves as a reference for my skills and knowledge, and demonstrates my ability to apply what I have learned in real-world scenarios.

I hope that this repository will help other students, as well as potential employers, to better understand my skills and abilities. I am constantly updating this repository with new assignments, so be sure to check back regularly to see my latest work.
